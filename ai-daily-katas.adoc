== RULES

* Track your daily kata progress. Mark each completed task with an [x].
* Each day, pick one Kata task from the list and complete it in 15–20 minutes.
** If it takes longer, don’t grind. Reflect, retry tomorrow, or ask a colleague.
** If you completed it much faster and still hungry - don’t go to the next task, experiment with different output formats , different prompts.
* Do a little everyday - better than a lot rarely.
